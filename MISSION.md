**STATUS**: This file is a co-working **draft**. When we officially launch the
governance system, it will be **explicitly approved** by everyone in the
Organization, and go through a round of **community feedback** in order to
create and maintain consent, trust and togetherness.

# Vision

Vision is a deep, fundamental orientation, direction and meaning, a source of
inspirational energy to act, that guides our work. Hints for deriving our
vision:

- What is the world we are striving for?
- If there was a magic wand and everything was possible, what would we most
  deeply want for ourselves, for those we love, for the community, for society,
  for the world?
- Be receptive, be open to our intuition, follow our curiosity

From our vision, we derive our *purpose* and *values*.

**Vision of Forgejo Organization**:

# Purpose

Purpose is the piece of the vision that is ours to do; that is an expression of
our innate gifts and is within our capacity to take on. Purpose is the "action"
part of moving towards the vision, a verb. Hints for deriving our purpose:

- What piece of the vision are we called to take on?
- Why do we do what we do?
- What ignites our heart and is within our capacity?
- Whom are we serving?

From our purpose, we derive our *mission*(s).

# Mission

Mission is the overall kinds of action taken to bridge the gap between the
current reality and the vision; anchoring our purpose into action and tangibly
moving us towards vision. Mission is what's within our capacity to do that
moves us towards the purpose. Hints for deriving our mission:

- What are the concrete things we do that actively mobilize towards our purpose?
- Given our strengths, limitations, resources and situation, where does it make
  sense to focus energy in terms of what will be a step in the direction of
  realizing the purpose?
- Finding the highest level of action that realizes purpose and acts as an
  umbrella to organize the finer elements

From our mission(s), we derive our
[roadmap](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/discussions/issues/17).
