# Problem statement

Which library should we use for rendering charts on the server-side and client?

# Decision Outcome

After considering various options, we decided to use Apache eCharts as it was the closest match
to our decision drivers.

To support changing this decision in future, we also agreed to [a custom chart definition schema](0002. Only support pre-defined charts.md).

# Decision Drivers

## Must-have

* Server-side rendering (preferably as SVGs)
* Must be open source
* Active community
* Must be stable and likely to be supported for a long time
* Good documentation
* Does not introduce new dependencies
* Does not have a history of security vulnerabilities
* Available features
 - Support for layering more interactivity (through CSS animations and/or JS hydration client-side)
 - Geo/map-based visualizations (minimum 2D)
 - Customizable visual design (like color palette and patterns/textures for better accessibility)
* i18n ready (essentially, can we support multilingualism with it)
* Intuitive / easy-to-learn syntax for building charts

## Nice-to-have

* Support for hyperlinks (so we could do things like link to articles from chart labels or descriptions)
* Time-based animations
* 3D visualizations

# Considered Options

We considered the following libraries:
* Apache eCharts
* Vega
* TeeChart:
* DataDraw
* Chart.js
* Plotly.js
* RGraph
* Our World in Data grapher
* D3
* Observable Plot
* Mermaid
